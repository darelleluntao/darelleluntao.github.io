👋 Hi, I’m Darelle!
💻 I’m a Flutter and ReactJS enthusiast who turns coffee into code and bugs into features.  
🚀 I specialize in building beautiful, cross-platform apps that don’t just work—they *wow*.

🛠️ Tech Stack:  
- Flutter: Because why choose between Android and iOS when you can have both?  
- ReactJS: Making the web interactive, one component at a time.  
- Backend: PHP, Node.js, Firebase (because even apps need a backbone).  
- Tools: Git (for those "oops" moments), VsCode, Android Studio, Arc, and a lot of patience.

🌟 Projects: -- This will be soon available at app store and play store.
- [Okane Money Management App](##): Because adulting is hard, but tracking expenses shouldn’t be.  
- [NASA Mars Rover Gallery](##): Bringing Mars to your phone, one rover photo at a time.  

🌱 I’m currently learning:  
- CyberSecurity and Mobile Architecture.
- Bunch of unfinished Coursera and Udemy. 🤓

🔭 I’m exploring:  
- new Career opportunities.
- Sony Camera Remote APIs 

🎯 Goals:
- Launch my App Ideas. 
- I promise to be more active on my Github profile and Portfolio this 2025.
- To create apps that make people say, “Wait, this was made by one person?!”  
- To finally write a bug-free code (just kidding, we all know that’s a myth).  

⚡ Fun facts:  
- I can debug code faster than I can decide what to watch on Netflix.  
- I once spent 3 hours fixing a bug, only to realize I forgot to save the file.
